SIREn is a high-performance, full-featured semi-structured text search engine
library.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The SIREn core API is extending the Lucene framework to provide indexing
and searching of arbitrary JSON documents.

<h2>Data Model behind SIREn</h2>

<p>
SIREn adopts an abstract tree model to represent semi-structured information.
Common examples of tree-based models are XML and JSON. While the
abstract tree model of SIREn could be used to index and search XML or JSON
documents, the SIREn API has been developed around the JSON data format. JSON
structure is simpler and therefore can be processed more efficiently, is more
easier to read by human, and is closer to the object-oriented model.
</p>

<h3>Abstract Tree Model</h3>

<p>
Each document in SIREn is represented as a tree, the root node of the tree
being the top-level object (which can be seen as the JSON document). The
child nodes of the root represent the fields associated to the top-level
object. The child nodes of a field node represent the values associated
to this field. A value can either be a:
<ul>
<li> a primitive value: string, number, boolean;
<li> an array; or
<li> an object.
</ul>

For example, the following JSON object

<pre>
{

  "name" : "Minsky",

  "born" : 1927

}
</pre>

can be represented as the following tree model

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc-files/object-tree-model.png" alt="Tree model for a JSON object"/>
</div>
</p>

<p>
A field associated to an array is represented as a node with multiple child
nodes, one child node per value in the array. In the case of nested arrays,
one nested array is represented by a blank node with one or more child nodes.
For example, the following JSON object

<pre>
{

  "array" : [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ], 5 ]

}
</pre>

can be represented as the following tree model

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc-files/array-tree-model.png" alt="Tree model for JSON arrays"/>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Similarly, a nested object is represented using a blank node with one or more
child nodes, one child node per field. For example, the following JSON object

<pre>
{

  "name"   : "Alice"
  "knows"  : { "name" : "Bob" }

}
</pre>

can be represented as the following tree model

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc-files/nested-object-tree-model.png" alt="Tree model for JSON nested objects"/>
</div>
</p>

<h3>Node-Labelled Tree Model</h3>

<p>
SIREn adopts a node-labelled tree model to capture the relation between the
nodes of a tree. A node-labelled tree model enables one to encode
and efficiently establish relationships between the nodes
of a tree. The two main types of relations are Parent-Child and
Ancestor-Descendant which are also core operations
in XML query languages such as XPath. To support these relations, the
requirement is to assign to each node unique identifiers that encode
the relationships between the nodes. To do so, SIREn uses the Dewey Order
encoding labelling scheme.
</p>

<p>
In Dewey Order encoding, each node is assigned a vector that represents the
path from the tree’s root to the node and each component of the path
represents the local order of an ancestor node. Using this labelling scheme,
structural relationships between elements can be determined efficiently. An
element u is an ancestor of an element v if label(u) is a prefix of label(v).
For example, the figure below depicts a data tree where nodes have been
labelled using Dewey’s encoding. Given the term 'Minsky' labelled with
[1.1.1], we can check that the term 'name' labelled with [1.1] belongs to
its parent node.

</div>
</p>

<h3>Concise Tree Model</h3>

<p>
Since 1.2, SIREn proposed a concise tree model which combines the benefits of the
field-based model of Lucene with the node-labelled tree model of SIREn.
The field-based model encodes the path information of a term in the dictionary
by prepending the path to the term, and enables more efficient attribute-value lookups.
For example, the following JSON object

<pre>
{

  "name"   : "Alice"
  "knows"  : [
    { "name" : "Bob" },
    { "name" : "Carl" }
  ]
}
</pre>

can be represented as the following tree model

<div align="center">
    <img src="doc-files/nested-object-hybrid-tree-model.png" alt="Concise tree model for JSON nested objects"/>
</div>

This model creates one node per attribute-object and attribute-value pair. In comparison with the previous approach
where each object introduces a "blank node", it groups an attribute and an object into one single node. To be able to
distinguish between multiple objects, it duplicates the intermediate attribute node for each attribute-object pair.
</p>

<p>
This concise tree model is implemented for the JSON data model by the
{@link com.sindicetech.siren.analysis.ConciseJsonTokenizer}.
The resulting concise model offers a more compact tree model and better overall performance in the
exchange of flexibility. More precisely, a field name of a JSON
object is not considered anymore as content of a node but as metadata of a node. The consequence
is that (1) the field names cannot be tokenised, and (2) the full-text search on field names is not
possible anymore.
</p>

<h2>Query Model</h2>

<p>
SIREn provides two types of query operators: the first one is a set of query
operators over the content of the tree, the second one is a set of query
operators over the structure of the tree.
</p>

<h3>Content Operators</h3>

<p>
The content operators are the only ones that access the content of a node
and are orthogonal to the structure operators. In fact, the content operators
are a one to one mapping to the original Lucene query operators.
</p>

<p>
The atomic search element is a keyword. Multiple keywords can be combined
with traditional keyword search operations. Such operations include boolean
operators (intersection, union, difference), proximity operators (phrase),
fuzzy or wildcard operators, range operators, etc. These operators give the
ability to express complex keyword queries.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Lucene where a keyword query is meant to retrieve a
particular set of documents, a keyword query in SIREn is used to retrieve a
particular set of nodes.
Also, the content operators allow to restrict keyword search to a particular
set of nodes using <em>node constraints</em>. A node constraint is either
a constraint on the level (in the tree) of the node or an interval constraint
on the node label. An interval constraint on the node label matches all
node labels that occurs in the inclusive interval.
</p>

<h3>Structure Operators</h3>

<p>
The structure operators are accessing the structure of the data tree. The
atomic search element is a node. Multiple nodes can be combined using tree
and set operators. The tree operators, i.e. the Ancestor-Descendant and
Parent-Child operators, allow to query node relationships and to retrieve
the paths matching a given pattern. The combination of paths are possible
using set operators.

<ul>
<li><b>Ancestor-Descendant:</b> A node A is the ancestor of a node D if there
exists a path between A and D. The operator checks the node labels and
retains only relations where the label of A is a prefix of the label of D.
<li><b>Parent-Child:</b> A node P is the parent of a node C if P is an
ancestor of C and C is exactly one level above P. The operator checks the
node labels and retains only relations where the label of P is the longest
prefix matching the label of C.
<li><b>Set manipulation operators:</b> These operators enable the
manipulation of nodes as sets, implementing union, difference and
intersection.
<li><b>Positional operators:</b> These operators enable the manipulation of
nodes based on their position, e.g., by specifying proximity and order constraints
on the nodes.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Implementation of the Model</h2>

<p>
We describe in this section how the tree model is implemented on top of an
inverted index. We first describe how we extend the inverted index data
structure before explaining the query processing algorithms.
</p>

<h3>Node-Based Inverted Index</h3>

<p>
An inverted index is composed of (1) a lexicon, i.e., a dictionary of terms
that allows fast term lookup; and (2) of a set of inverted lists, one
inverted list per term. In a node-based inverted index, the node labels, or
Dewey’s vectors, that are associated with each term are stored within the
inverted lists. Compared to the traditional Lucene inverted index, the
difference is situated in the structure of the inverted lists. Originally,
an inverted list is composed of a list of document identifiers, a list of
term frequencies and a list of term positions. In our implementation, an
inverted list is composed of:
<ul>
<li> a list of document identifiers;
<li> a list of node frequencies, a node frequency corresponds to the number
of nodes where the term has been mentioned;
<li> a list of node labels;
<li> a list of term frequencies, a term frequency is relative to a node label
and corresponds to the number of times the term has been mentioned in a node;
<li> a list of term positions, a term position is relative to a node label
and correponds to the position of the term within the node.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Query Processing</h3>

<p>
The evaluation of a query works in a bottom-up fashion. First, matching on
the content (terms) of a node is performed, then node information is used
during list intersection for filtering the result candidates that do not
belong to a same node or branch of the tree.
</p>

<p>
The intersection of two inverted lists is the most common operation during
query processing. For example, a content operator such as the boolean
intersection and phrase proximity operators relies on a list intersection.
The structure operators such as the Ancestor-Descendant, Parent-Child and
boolean intersection operators also rely on list intersection. The
methodology is identical for all of them and is described by the following
merge algorithm:

<ol>
<li> The inverted list of each term is retrieved.
<li> We position the pointers to the first element of each inverted list.
<li> We then walk through the inverted lists simultaneously. At each step, we
perform the following operations:
  <ol>
  <li> We first compare their document identifiers. If they are not equal, we
  move forward the list pointer with the smallest identifier to its next
  position.
  <li> We then compare their node labels. If the comparison is positive, we
  add the document identifier and node label to the result list and we
  advance the list pointers to their next position. If the comparison is
  negative, we move forward the list pointer with the smallest identifier to
  its next position.
  </ol>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
However, the comparison between node labels that is performed at step
3.2 is slightly different depending on the query operator employed. In the
case of a boolean intersection between two words, the comparison is based on
the equality of the node labels. In the case of a proximity operator, the
position information is additionally compared. Concerning Ancestor-Descendant
and Parent-Child operators, the comparison is based on the label prefix
matching between the ancestor node label and child node label.
</p>
