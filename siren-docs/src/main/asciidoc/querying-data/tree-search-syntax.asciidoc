== Tree Search Syntax

This section presents the query syntax for the tree search queries in SIREn. This query syntax maps to the internal
tree model of SIREn.
A tree query enables the search of nodes or combination of nodes through different relationships.
The atomic element in a tree search query is a node. Nodes can then be combined using parent-child or
ancestor-descendant relationships, boolean and proximity operators.
The full query syntax is based on JSON. Each query operator is a JSON object, and these objects can be combined
and nested to form complex queries.

SIREn provides a
http://siren.solutions/javadoc/current/com/sindicetech/siren/qparser/tree/dsl/package-summary.html[query builder] in Java for
composing a tree search query and generating the corresponding JSON syntax.
