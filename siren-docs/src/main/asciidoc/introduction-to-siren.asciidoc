SIREn is a highly scalable open-source full-text search engine especially suited for nested and schemaless data. It
can be used standalone, similar to Lucene, and it comes in the form of Elasticsearch and Solr plugins. SIREn has its
own data model which is better suited for nested documents such as JSON and XML. The next sections give an overview of
SIREn's architecture, its model and and the model's implications on querying.
